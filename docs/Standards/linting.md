# Linting

Linting is a process that allows us to maintain code quality and enforce code conventions.
- ESLint is the compound language of ES(EcmaScript) + Lint(show error code), and analyzes the source code, and the tool that helps to make them the same style.
- Prettier is a Code Formatter, makes the same code style by rules. 
- Husky is an NPM package which utilizes GIT hooks to integrate tools and increase quality code submissions to your repository.
