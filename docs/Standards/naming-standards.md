# Naming Standards

## Folder Naming

- use lower case to all folder names.
- Avoid abbreviations for folder names.

## File Naming

- Always use **Pascal Case** for file name with file type. for example if we are creating `animated slilder` component then the name should be `AnimatedSlider.component.tsx` ans the style file should be `AnimatedSlider.style.ts`.
- Use full word in compound text instead of abbreviations.
- Easily identify Higher order components with `hoc` prefix. eg: `ComponentName.hoc.tsx`

## Variables and functions Naming

- variables and function named should be written in **camelCase**. eg:`let some = 10`
- global variables and constants should be written in **UPPERCASE**. eg: `const HEIGHT = 10`
