# Analytics

To implement push notifications in React Native using Firebase, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project: 
    - Go to the Firebase console and create a new project.
    - Follow the steps to create a new project and give it a name.
2. Add Firebase to your React Native project: 
    - Add Firebase to your React Native project by installing the `react-native-firebase` package.
      ```bash 
        npm install --save react-native-firebase
      ```
3. Add Analytics to your Firebase project:
    - Go to the Firebase console, select your project.
    - Click on "Analytics" in the left-hand menu. 
    - Follow the instructions to add Analytics to your project.
4. Initialize Firebase in your React Native app: 
    - To initialize Firebase in your React Native app by adding the following code to your index.js or App.js file:
    ```bash
      import firebase from 'react-native-firebase';

      firebase.initializeApp({
        // Your Firebase config object goes here
      });
    ```
    - Replace the comment with your Firebase configuration object.(Firebase config object can be in the Firebase console under Project Settings > Your Apps > Firebase SDK snippet).
5. Log events: 
    - To log events in your React Native app, you can use the logEvent method provided by Firebase Analytics. Here's an example:
    ```bash
      import firebase from 'react-native-firebase';

      firebase.analytics().logEvent('my_event', {
        param1: 'value1',
        param2: 'value2',
      });
    ```
6. View Analytics data: 
    - View the analytics data in the Firebase console. 
    - Go to the Firebase console, select your project, and click on "Analytics" in the left-hand menu.
    - From here, you can view various reports and metrics related to user behavior in your app.
