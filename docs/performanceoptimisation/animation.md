# Animation

## runOnUI and runOnJS

When we are working with animation, we are not sure that its working on UI thread or JS thread. For making this more transparent, Reanimated indroduces `runOnUI` and `runOnJS`.

runOnUI enables executing worklet functions on the UI thread. Note that UI execution is asynchronous from the callerâ€™s perspective. When you pass arguments, they will be copied to the UI context.

```js
const onPress = () => {
  runOnUI(someWorklet)("Howdy");
};
```

runOnJS which calls a callback asynchronously. An exception will be thrown if you call a JS callback without this function.

```js
useDerivedValue(() => {
  runOnJS(externalLibraryFunction)(args);
});
```
