# App Bundle

## Reduce app size

We all know that react native apps are little bit heavier than comparing to other cross platform apps. We can reduce the app size with some simple steps.

### Enable proguard

Proguard is a tool that can slightly reduce the size of the APK. It does this by stripping parts of the React Native Java bytecode (and its dependencies) that your app is not using. Make sure to thoroughly test your app if you've enabled Proguard.

```yml title='android/app/build.gradle'
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true
```

### Enable Separate Builds

If youâ€™re looking for an alternative to the Android App bundle, this is the one to **Minimize App Size React Native** application. There are two major architectures supported by android devices: armeabi and x86. So when you generate the apk using React Native, react libraries are included in both architectures. So to generate two different are following command is used.

```yml title='android/app/build.gradle'
def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = true
```
