# React

[Official Documentation](https://react.dev/)

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and released in 2013. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and compose them into complex UIs.

React is often used for building single-page applications and is particularly well-suited for building web applications with dynamic user interfaces. React utilizes a declarative programming model, where the developer specifies what the UI should look like, and React handles the updates and rendering of the UI based on changes to the application state.

## Features of React

- Declarative programming: React uses a declarative programming model, where the developer specifies what the UI should look like, and React handles the updates and rendering of the UI based on changes to the application state. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the UI, and to write code that is more concise and easier to maintain.

- Component-based architecture: React allows developers to create reusable UI components and compose them into complex UIs. This makes it easier to break down complex UIs into smaller, more manageable pieces, and to reuse those pieces across different parts of the application.

- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. This allows React to efficiently update the UI when changes occur, without having to manipulate the actual DOM directly. This approach can result in better performance, particularly for large and complex UIs.

- JSX: React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. This makes it easier to create and manipulate UI elements, and to combine HTML and JavaScript in a single file.

- Unidirectional data flow: React uses a unidirectional data flow, where data flows down from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the UI, and to write code that is more predictable and easier to test.

- Developer tools: React has a rich set of developer tools, including the React Developer Tools browser extension, which allows developers to inspect and debug React applications.

## React components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. Components are essentially reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create a larger, more complex UI.

```jsx
function ComponentName(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```
