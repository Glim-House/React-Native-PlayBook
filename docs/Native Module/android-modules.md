# Android Modules

[Official Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android)

Some android related platform APIs are not available in the react-native itself. So, we have to create native modules. To create a new native module in android, must have a basic knowledge in java/kotlin and how to use android studio.

Steps to create android modules
  - Creating Native Module.
  - Exposing Native Module.
  - Registering the module.
  - Testing.
